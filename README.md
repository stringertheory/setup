Setting up a new Mac.

Steps:
- Password Manager
- Terminal setup: set default to "Pro" profile, set font size to something nice, and change to "When the shell exits, close if the shell exited cleanly".
- Homebrew: https://brew.sh/
- Dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/
- Emacs: always a bit of a pain to get set up. As of December 2021, needed to use the `brew install --cask emacs` version for GUI, add MELPA package directory, fix some weird things (see stack overflow links in .emacs file), and change fonts, menus, etc.
- Brew install stuff (can do `brew leaves` on previous computer to see the top level packages that are installed)
- Git and github: get setup with ssh here https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
- Python: TKTK
- Screenotate: https://screenotate.com/

It's also been helpful to look at [this guide](http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/index.html).
